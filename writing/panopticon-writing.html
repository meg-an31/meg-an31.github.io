    <h1>why i loved living in a panopticon</h1>
    <p>my first year at uni was spent living on the top floor of the db building. it's roughly circular, entirely glass windows facing inwards to a small quad. in the centre is a tree, visible from every single room at all angles. without even seeing a photo it's clear what this sounds like. </p>
    <h3>surveillance</h3>
    <p>a panopticon is an architectural design used in prisons - a method of persisting surveillance to all inmates by stacking cells around the edge of a cylindrical space. in the centre is a watchtower with a 360 degree view of every cell. crucially, the prisoners have no idea when they&#39;re being watched it generates this </p>
    <h3>DB vs the panopticon</h3>
    <p>obviously there are some crucial differences between DB and a prison. most prominently, we had a way to cut the surveillance. clunky, panelled blinds that complained a bit when you tried to move them, but it was <em>a reliable privacy mechanism</em>. you have absolutely no reason to dissolve into the self-surveillance that panopticons usually promise.</p>
    <p>by doing this, however, you remove your entire outside view. the only other window in the room is thin and hence unsatisfying to look out of, existing more for ventilation than a view. closing your blinds leaves you with harsh florescent light and a blank fourth wall. </p>
    <p>but why was i worried? my privacy is important when it comes to. but those evenings i spent with a soft light on in my room and my curtains open are some of my most fond. </p>
    <h3>community</h3>
    <p>at the start of term i was very shy and unsure. going out at night necessitated that i <em>was</em> somebody that evening, which was a non-trivial request. so many people that i didn&#39;t know? and couldn&#39;t verify whether what i was saying was normal. and what the fuck is the right way to dance in the club?? </p>
    <p>it was a weird stroke of luck that the majority of my friend group lived directly opposite me in the panopticon. </p>
    <p>we had &quot;staircase parties&quot;; weirdly popular events where. people flowing in and out of rooms, climbing up and down stairs, like moving through a vein that ran along the building. </p>
    <h3>to see + be seen</h3>
    <p>shutting the curtains was tangibly miserable. opening them exposed me the art of being observed. this incremental increase in exposure was enough to teach me that it&#39;s actually okay if you have clothes piled up on your sofa, or if your fairy lights are slightly garish, or if you slept in until past midday, because other people do these things too! this tiny reduction in privacy was enough to starve off some of the perfectionism that threatened to destroy me. </p>
    <p>the ordeal of being seen was worth it to have the sun flood my room in the morning.</p>
