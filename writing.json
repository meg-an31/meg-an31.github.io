    "article": "I could never give up the menstrual cycle. I believe it is a gift, for all of its horror and agony, that I am able to see with such intricacy each aspect of my emotional self, explore each crevice, see every day in a different light. <p>One counterargument to this is that it results in illogical fits of emotion. However, humans are constantly guided by emotion and irrational split-second decisions. Knowing that the landscape of my mind is so variable and unpredictable allows me to take a step back from the immediate emotion that I feel. I have a built in mechanism to help me to reconsider. \nI am able to understand everything that happens to me in every different light. I am able to feel content with the same event that I previously wept over. Every possible understanding is given to me, spread over a month. I feel a once multifaceted emotion spread like a pack of cards over a month. Open and ready to be dissected and refined. It is a privilege to have such perception. \nI often feel as though it is the difference between remaining in your birth country for your whole life, and travelling across the whole world. Staying where you know is comforting, but you will never see the beauties that the Earth contains. Complete exploration is exhausting, demeaning, and often reveals vile disturbing truths that you could have blissfully ignored. Sometimes being exposed to these does nothing but sicken you. But the entire experience will harden you as an individual, building you into someone with an intricate understanding of where they are, and what they need to do next. "
